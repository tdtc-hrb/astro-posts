### IDE
- [VS2013](https://download.microsoft.com/download/A/A/D/AAD1AA11-FF9A-4B3C-8601-054E89260B78/vs2013.5_ce_enu.iso)    
VS 2010 is slower than ever, 2012 is less slow, 2013 is even less slow. 
I would go with the last one just to have more recent C++ features and excellent debugging experience. 
You might want to read about the issues and good sides of recent VS versions in this blog article

In VC++ (VS2005~VS2010) that does not support the C++11 standard:
```
CMainFrame() noexcept;
```
